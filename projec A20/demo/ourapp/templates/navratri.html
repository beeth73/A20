        <h2>Why is Navratri Celebrated?</h2>
        <p>Navratri, a nine-day Hindu festival, is celebrated to honor the divine feminine energy of the universe, embodied by the nine forms of Goddess Durga. The festival is a celebration of good over evil, knowledge over ignorance, and devotion over indifference.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Story Behind Navratri
         </p>
        <p>According to Hindu mythology, Navratri commemorates the battle between Goddess Durga and the buffalo-demon Mahishasura. Mahishasura, with his immense power and blessings from Lord Brahma, had become invincible and was terrorizing the gods and humans alike.

         </p>
         <p>The gods, led by Lord Indra, approached Lord Brahma, Lord Vishnu, and Lord Shiva to find a solution. The three gods combined their powers to create Goddess Durga, a fierce warrior goddess with unmatched strength and beauty.
        </p>
         <p>Goddess Durga, riding a lion, fought Mahishasura and his army for nine days. On the tenth day, she beheaded Mahishasura, restoring peace and order to the universe. This battle is celebrated as Navratri, with each day representing a different form of Goddess Durga.
        </p>
         <p>The Nine Forms of Goddess Durga
        </p>
         <p>Each day of Navratri is dedicated to a different form of Goddess Durga, each with its unique characteristics and attributes:
        </p>
         <p>1. Shailaputri: Embodies the collective power of the gods and is worshiped on the first day.</p>
           <p>2. Brahmacharini: Symbolizes devotion, knowledge, and spirituality, and is worshiped on the second day.</p>
          <p> 3. Chandraghanta: Embodies beauty, courage, and strength, and is worshiped on the third day.</p>
          <p>  4. Kushmanda: Symbolizes abundance, prosperity, and good health, and is worshiped on the fourth day.</p>
          <p> 5. Skandamata: Embodies motherly love, protection, and care, and is worshiped on the fifth day.</p>
          <p> 6. Katyayani: Symbolizes courage, strength, and determination, and is worshiped on the sixth day.</p>
          <p> 7. Kalaratri: Embodies time, change, and destruction, and is worshiped on the seventh day.</p>
          <p> 8. Mahakali: Symbolizes the ultimate power of time and change, and is worshiped on the eighth day.</p>
          <p> 9. Mahanavami: Embodies the culmination of the divine feminine energy and is worshiped on the ninth day.</p>
            

        <h2>Additional Information</h2>
        <p>Navaratri is celebrated in different ways throughout India. Certain people revere different aspects of Durga and some people fast while others feast. The Chaitra Navaratri culminates in Ram Navami and the Sharada Navaratri culminates in Durga Puja and Vijayadashami.
        </p>
        <p>In the past, Shakta Hindus used to recite Durga's legends during the Chaitra Navaratri around the spring equinox . For most contemporary Hindus, it is the Navaratri around the autumn equinox that is the major festival and the one observed. To Bengali Hindus and to Shakta Hindus outside of eastern and northeastern states of India, the term Navaratri implies Durga Puja in the warrior goddess aspect of Devi. In other traditions of Hinduism, the term Navaratri implies the celebration of Durga but in her more peaceful forms, such as Saraswati â€“ the Hindu goddess of knowledge, learning, music, and other arts. In Nepal, Navaratri is called Dashain, and is a major annual homecoming and family event that celebrates the bonds between elders and youngsters with Tika Puja, as well as across family and community members. 
        </p>
       
        <p>Navaratri is celebrated as the Durga Puja festival by Bengali Hindus, Assamese people, Bihari people, Tripuri people, Maithils, Nepalese people, Bhutanese people, Burmese people, Odia people as well as some minor tribal ethnicities in Bangladesh and India such as Santal people, Chakma people, Manipuri people and others. It is the most important annual festival to Bengali Hindus and a major social and public event in eastern and northeastern states of India, where it dominates the religious life. The occasion is celebrated with thousands of pandals (temporary stages) that are built in community squares, roadside shrines, and large Durga temples in West Bengal, Odisha, Jharkhand, Bihar, eastern Nepal, Assam, Tripura, and nearby regions. It is also observed by some Shakta Hindus as a private, home-based festival. Durga Puja festival marks the victory of the goddess Durga in the battle against the shape-shifting, deceptive, and powerful buffalo demon Mahishasura.
        </p>
        <p>The festival begins with Mahalaya, a day where Shakta Hindus remember the loved ones who have died, as well the advent of the warrior goddess Durga. The next significant day of Durga Puja is called Shashthi, on which the local community welcomes the goddess Durga and festive celebrations are inaugurated. On the seventh (Saptami), eighth (Ashtami), and ninth (Navami) day, Durga, along with Lakshmi, Saraswati, Ganesha, and Kartikeya, are revered. These days mark the main Puja (worship) which is performed by the recitation of scriptures, legends of Durga in the Devi Mahatmya, and social visits by families to temples and pandals. On the tenth day, also known as Vijayadashami, a great procession is held where clay statues of Durga are ceremoniously walked to a river or ocean coast for a solemn goodbye. Many mark their faces with vermilion (sindooram) or dress in red clothes. It is an emotional day for some devotees, and the congregation sings emotional goodbye songs. After the procession, Hindus distribute sweets, gifts, and visit their friends and family members.
        </p>
        <p>Durga Puja is celebrated commonly by both Bangladesh's Bengali and non-Bengali Hindu communities. Many Bengali Muslims also take part in the festivities. In Dhaka, the Dhakeshwari Temple puja attracts visitors and devotees. In Nepal, the festivities are celebrated as Dashain.
